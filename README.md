### This project aims to refine React.js skills while mastering API fetching techniques.

Leveraging the Recipe Search API from Edemam.com, the website offers access to an extensive database containing tens of thousands of recipes. Users can effortlessly search for their favorite dishes, instantly retrieving ingredient lists. For those seeking further culinary guidance, the platform seamlessly redirects to detailed recipes, providing step-by-step instructions on how to prepare each dish.

### Familiarized myself with:

> - Asynchronous API (async/await)
> - components, props, styled components, etc.
